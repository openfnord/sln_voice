Deploying the Firmware with Native Windows
******************************************

This document explains how to deploy the software using `CMake` and `NMake`. If you are not using native Windows MSVC build tools and instead using a Linux emulation tool such as WSL, refer to :doc:`Deploying the Firmware with Linux or macOS <linux_macos>`.

Building the Firmware
=====================

Run the following commands in the root folder to build the firmware:

.. code-block:: console

    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -B build -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
    cd build
    nmake example_ffd

Running the Firmware
====================

Before the firmware is run, the filesystem must be loaded.

Inside of the build folder root, after building the firmware:

.. code-block:: console

    nmake flash_fs_example_ffd

Once flashed, the application will run.

After the filesystem has been flashed once, the application can be run without flashing.  If changes are made to the filesystem image, the application must be reflashed.

From the build folder run:

.. code-block:: console

    nmake run_example_ffd

Debugging the Firmware
======================

To debug with xgdb, from the build folder run:

.. code-block:: console

    nmake debug_example_ffd
